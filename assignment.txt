Machine Learning Assignment

In this assignment, you will examine a chosen data set and the associated paper, and then apply Machine Learning to the data using the Weka software.

You have a choice of 3 data sets and Machine Learning tasks:

1. Classifying pottery based on their chemical compositions (https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/18/11214/htm)
2. Estimating the sex of human skulls, based on their measurements (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/18/9285)
3. Classifying types of Middle Eastern pottery based on measurements (https://hdl.handle.net/1887/3421358)

Choose the one you like the most, and if possible, don't all choose the same topic!

To get started, first read the paper linked to your chosen data. In case of the thesis (choice number 3), read sections 1 and 2, and also have a look at table 3.1. 



Your presentation should contain the following elements:

- An introduction to the problem (summary of paper/thesis)
- A short description of the data
- A results table (F1 for each class) of the best performing Machine Learning algorithm
- A brief explanation of the Machine Learning method used
- Optional: anything interesting you found during your experiments
